# Muon Induced Neutrinos (mineut)

Generating neutrino fluxes at muon storage rings like neutrino factories and muon colliders.

* `mineut/MuC.py` contains all the main classes for generating muon decay events along a specific geometry.

* The optics of the collider rings are generated in the notebook `create_beam_optics_files.ipynb`.
